The program will ask us to input information and it will save it until next time you run the program. Every time we run it it will display the information as a message. The first time it runs it will not display a message. The program also keeps a log where it tells us what its doing.

The information will be stored in a file called rememberData and the log will be stored in a file called log; these files will be created the first time the program runs and will be located in the same folder as the program
